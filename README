hnfs
===

hnfs is a fuse filesystem for mounting hacker news (http://news.ycombinator.com)
as a filesystem.

Mounting it to a directory will fill that directory with a directory for each
of the 30 stories on the front page. Each directory contains three files in
it: content.html, redirect.html, and url. Content.html will contain the
raw html of the story linked. This may not always work correctly, so
redirect.html has html that triggers an http redirect to the url for the given
story.  Either way, opening these files in a browser should lead allow you
to read the posted story. The url file simply contains the url of the story.

Currently

Right now, we're just reading stories from a json file we have stored within
the project. This is beacuse hn does not have a proper api for accessing
stories on the front page. Once I hnfs working reliably with the json file
I'll probably write something with ruby and Sinatra to scrape the front page
and put an api in front of it. This isn't ideal... but it seems to be the only
way right now.

Plans

I'm hoping to have a way to nicely convert comments into a file that can be
easily read in the terminal. That will most likely look something like this:

coolguy102: I think that startup culture is so and so, but really using
anything other than javascript in modern projects is just asking to be labeled
as a dinosaur.
  newshacker420: Actually, coolguy102, I think you might be behind on the times
  Clojure is really the way to go when it comes to today's projects.
    coolguy102: Well sure, if you want to be some kind of functional
    programming hipster about it.
  noonecaresaboutme: Actually, I think you'll find that using Enterprise
  Java Beans by Oracle for enterprises in warehouses, enterprise version
  2.53 actually creates a nice workflow where only 80% of your code ends
  up being boilerplace.
pg: You should probably be using common lisp.
